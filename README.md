# Express API Project Frontend

This project developed during my time at coding bootcamp. During development, I gained an insight into how the backend works and created my first API. In this latest update, I added a search function with the possibility to search by title to the API.

## What's new?

- Possibility to search by title on frontend.
- Showing other items from shows array on a single show page.
- Added documentation as a single page.

This frontend project is just for the demonstration of this API. You can find all links down below.
